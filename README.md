# Signal Equalizer Desktop Application

## Introduction

Signal equalization is a fundamental tool in various industries such as music, speech, and biomedicine. This desktop application aims to provide users with the ability to modify the magnitude of specific frequency components within a signal and reconstruct the altered signal in real-time.

## Features

- **Uniform Range Mode:** Divide the total frequency range of the input signal into 10 equal segments, each controlled by a slider.
- **Musical Instruments Mode:** Adjust the magnitude of specific musical instruments within the input music signal.
- **Animal Sounds Mode:** Control the magnitude of specific animal sounds within a mixture of animal sounds.
- **ECG Abnormalities Mode:** Modify the magnitude of arrhythmia components in ECG signals.
- **Multiplication/Smoothing Windows:** Choose from four smoothing windows (Rectangle, Hamming, Hanning, Gaussian) for modifying frequency ranges.
- **Mode Switching:** Easily switch between different modes through an option menu or combobox.
- **UI Customization:** Sliders' captions and number may change based on the selected mode.
- **Linked Cine Signal Viewers:** Two synchronized viewers for input and output signals with functionality panel for playback, zoom, pan, etc.
- **Spectrograms:** Visualize input and output signals' spectrograms with real-time updates upon slider changes.
